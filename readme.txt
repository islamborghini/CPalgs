These are some algorithms of CP that might be useful:
  1)  Theory of Graphs:
          1.1) Dijkstra algorithm - finding all short from one point
          1.2) Ford-Bellman algorithm - shortest path from one point, negative edges allowed
          1.3) Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm - shortest path for all points. O(n^3)
  2)  Binary Search algorithm
  3)  Sorting algorithms: 
          3.1) Bubble Sort
