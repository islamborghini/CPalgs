These are some algorithms of CP that might be useful:
  1)  Theory of Graphs:
          Dijkstra algorithm - finding all short from one point
          Ford-Bellman algorithm - shortest path from one point, negative edges allowed
          Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm - shortest path for all points. O(n^3)
  2)  Binary Search algorithm
